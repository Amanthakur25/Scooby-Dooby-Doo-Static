            <span className=" text-bold text-3xl text-white">Priya Raghuvanshi</span>, who
            has an MBA degree, is the creator of the cage-free dog boarding
            concept, which was born out of her empathy for dogs being locked up
            in dog boarding kennels. Priya is a life-long animal lover, and she
            knew that there had to be a happier way to provide boarding for dogs
            and with the help of an expert dog trainer, she soon learned a very
            important fact: all dogs are inherently social pack animals. This
            means that they can get along with other strange dogs in a new
            environment as long as they are in a balanced pack with a strong,
            confident, and fair leader). She found that if you evaluate every
            dog first and follow the steps of careful introduction, pack
            socialization and consistent leadership, that a balanced pack can be
            created and maintained in a boarding facility 24-hours-a-day, which
            is the key to the success of Scooby dooby doo.
          </p>
          <p>
            Priya also has another wonderful attribute that has had a profound
            effect on the personality of Scooby dooby doo pet hotel and that is
            her belief that everything she does in life has got to be first
            class. Simply being cage-free was not good enough and everything at
            our SDD house had to have the feel of a first-class hotel.
