                <span className="text-bold text-3xl text-white">Priya Raghuvanshi</span>, who
                has an MBA degree, is the creator of the cage-free dog boarding
                concept, which was born out of her empathy for dogs being locked up
                in dog boarding kennels. Priya is a life-long animal lover, and she
                knew that there had to be a happier way to provide boarding for dogs
                and with the help of an expert dog trainer, she soon learned a very
                important fact: all dogs are inherently social pack animals. This
                means that they can get along with other strange dogs in a new
                environment as long as they are in a balanced pack with a strong,
                confident, and fair leader. She found that if you evaluate every
                dog first and follow the steps of careful introduction, pack
                socialization and consistent leadership, that a balanced pack can be
                created and maintained in a boarding facility 24-hours-a-day, which
                is the key to the success of Scooby dooby doo.
              </p>
              <p>
                Priya also has another wonderful attribute that has had a profound
                effect on the personality of Scooby dooby doo pet hotel and that is
                her belief that everything she does in life has got to be first
                class. Simply being cage-free was not good enough and everything at
                our SDD house had to have the feel of a first-class hotel.
